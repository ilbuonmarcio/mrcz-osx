# Hackintosh/Ryzentosh OpenCore builds

Those are my OpenCore builds for desktop PCs and mobile notebooks

Don't use those as quick-and-dirty built setups, but treat them as documentation of good setups!

For other information, check both [the official guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide) and the [config.plist checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/)!
